On 29  Nov 2021 I was looking In my email and an interesting email pop up with text.

And things getting interesting for me ,I read  the task.The task is to search artist and display their name and Facebook and when user click on artists, their upcoming events show on the screen and write test cases and deploy strategy.Testing for react and deployment I heard about it but haven’t did before.So its quite interesting to always learn new things.




Planning phase:

Which stack I should opt for
This phase include brain storming what type of architecture I should opt for
What will be the best suitable architecture 
What should be the name of project
What type of use Cases I should implement 
And designing of course it was open ended for me.

So moving forward I write it down and set some standards for coding and project


Architecture:

I opted react for this specific task .

So month ago I read about one of best architecture is Atomic design for React.
Look here for best explanation https://medium.com/@janelle.wg/atomic-design-pattern-how-to-structure-your-react-application-2bb4d9ca5f97

Or this image holds all the story



There are plenty of benefits for using this architecture.






I divide my project into smallest possible components and then these combined to make a section and these section combine to build a page. 


Dateset

I applied for BandisTown API but didn’t get any app keys to use in my project.So I add dummy data using  https://www.mockaroo.com/ 
for generating data same as mentioned.
So as soon as I get keys I will incorporate in my app.

Deployment: 

Moving toward deployment phase I use  https://app.netlify.com/

And my site is currently hosted on

https://stoic-nobel-575ba4.netlify.app/


GitHub and local Build:Currently I am using a local build and publish to netlify.
Another method is to  attach your GitHub repository with netlify so when you do any changes it will automatically reflect on your live hosting .

How to run React App in to Your machine?


Clone Artistic Repository
Go to project folder and run npm install. It will automatically install all your dependencies.
Now in your root repository run npm start.






Remarks:

Its a wonderful project to be working on for me
Its just a prototype and I have plan to work on it as release future versions with complete functionalities.
